  abstract = {Power Quality (PQ) disturbances have an impact on electrical installations and equipment. Waveform distortions like harmonics create additional losses and reduce the efficiency of the power converter controls, and therefore should be kept below admissible limits to cope with Standards and regulatory schemes. Relying on accurate predictions of the future values of harmonics can help distribution system operators and clients in taking timely actions to comply with the admissible limits. This paper provides probabilistic methodologies to forecast current harmonics in short-term horizons. The methodologies are based on Quantile Regression (QR) models and are diversified based on the forecasting task: disaggregated forecasts of harmonics at each time interval are provided through a direct approach while daily or weekly percentile aggregated forecasts are provided through either a direct or an indirect approach. The proposed methodologies are applied on actual data collected from Low-Voltage (LV) installations to evaluate their predictive performance. The methodologies improve the performance from 22\% to 43\%, compared to a naive persistence benchmark.},

  abstract = {Distribution systems are supplying many customers with electricity requiring a high number of equipment and lines. It is tedious to analyze all low-voltage (LV) networks of a distribution system operator (DSO). Because of the large number of LV-networks within the system benchmark networks are required. For bulk analysis the networks have to represent a large number of networks within the system. For extreme value analysis the most critical networks have to be identified and examined. Benchmark networks representing typical LVnetworks for bulk analysis can be derived from technical data of these networks using multivariate methods. This paper describes the data allocation and application of cluster analysis for this purpose. The presented benchmark networks are based on German conditions. The networks are also reviewed under the aspect of feasibility. The benchmark networks are characterized by their supply obligation as well as the network data and properties are given for benchmark analysis. The paper also includes the diverse experience in data allocation, analysis of the data and gives assistants for prospective data allocation combined with cluster analysis of LV-networks. With the information given in the paper also benchmark networks adapted to a variety of other applications can be derived.},

  abstract = {Power quality levels in public low voltage grids are influenced by many factors which can either be assigned to the electrical environment (connected consumers, connected generation, network characteristics) or to the non-electrical environment (e.g. climatic conditions) at the measurement site. Type and amount of connected consumers (consumer topology) are expected to have a very high impact on power quality (PQ) levels. The usage behaviour of equipment by customers usually varies over the year. Subsequently the levels of PQ parameters like harmonics may show a seasonal variation. The aim of the paper is the identification and quantification of these seasonal variations. It starts with a systematic overview of major factors impacting Power Quality levels and continues with the classification of the typical types of their variation (short-term, medium-term and long-term). Next a two-stage approach based on time series decomposition is introduced in order to quantify seasonal variations by a set of indices. Finally several existing long-term measurements of public LV grids lasting more than one year are selected for a comprehensive illustration of the method. The sites represent different consumer topologies, like shops, offices and residential areas. Seasonal variations are quantified in detail for these sites and selected current quality parameters.},

  abstract = {Power quality (PQ) levels in public low voltage grids are influenced by many factors like type of connected customers, level of distributed generation or climatic conditions. In particular, type and number of the connected electronic equipment have a significant impact on PQ levels. Therefore, the introduction of new device technologies on a large scale, like the transition from incandescent to LED lamps, might result in long-term changes to the levels of PQ parameters (e.g. harmonics). Major aims of the paper are the identification and quantification of long-term trends in time series of continuous PQ parameters which can support network operators with the early detection of fundamental changes in PQ levels. This information can e.g. support the asset management or network planning in managing PQ levels using optimized costs. The paper begins with a systematic overview of major factors with impact on PQ levels and continues with a classification of their typical variation behavior (short-term, medium-term and long-term). The analysis of the long-term behavior (trend) starts with the extraction of a smoothed trend component based on time series decomposition. This trend component is used to quantify global trends (looking on the measurement duration as a whole) and local trends (looking on individual segments of the whole time series). Finally, the application of both methods is illustrated for selected voltage and current quality parameters using a set of three year measurements from German LV grids with different consumer configuration.},

  abstract = {Power quality (PQ) is an increasing concern in the distribution networks of modern industrialized countries. The PQ monitoring activities of distribution system operators (DSO), and consequently the amount of PQ measurement data, continuously increase, and consequently new and automated tools are required for efficient PQ analysis. Time characteristics of PQ parameters (e.g., harmonics) usually show characteristic daily and weekly cycles, mainly caused by the usage behaviour of electric devices. In this paper, methods are proposed for the classification of harmonic emission profiles for typical consumer configurations in public low voltage (LV) networks using a binary decision tree in combination with support vector machines. The performance of the classification was evaluated based on 40 different measurement sites in German public LV grids. This method can support network operators in the identification of consumer configurations and the early detection of fundamental changes in harmonic emission behaviour. This enables, for example, assistance in resolving customer complaints or supporting network planning by managing PQ levels using typical harmonic emission profiles.},

The paper proposes a two-step modeling process, beginning with the determination of frequency-dependent impedance characteristics by field measurements or detailed network simulations. These characteristics are then used to fit generic equivalent circuit (EC) models, allowing for the representation of a wide range of typical impedance characteristics. Challenges encountered in the application of this framework, such as the selection of circuit topologies and parameter estimation methods, are discussed. The paper concludes with a demonstration of the suitability of various circuit models and outlines future research directions.},

The input data is mainly based on a survey among German distribution system operators (DSO), but also based on experiences and previous studies of the authors. Probabilistic simulation are used to obtain realistic distributions for important grid-related parameters like short circuit power. The results are presented separately for the low voltage (LV), medium voltage (MV), and high voltage (HV) grids. Based on the results, a set of reference networks for German LV, MV, and HV grids is proposed.},

  abstract = {In the last years voltage quality in the supply networks becomes more and more important for the distribution network operators (DNO). Moreover the interest of the European regulatory authorities (CEER) in voltage quality increases constantly over the last years. Due to the mentioned facts the number of power quality measurement campaigns and consequently the number of permanently installed power quality measurement instruments is growing continuously. To ensure the necessary accuracy of the measurement instruments, periodic accuracy verification is required. If the verification fails, the measurement instrument must be re-calibrated. Usually for both verification and calibration the measurement instrument must be send to the manufacturer. Especially in the case of a large number of permanently installed measurement instruments this is timeand cost-intensive and causes unwanted interruptions of the power quality measurements for several days or weeks. Maybe for this reason in many cases a measurement instrument is calibrated only sporadic or not at all. The paper describes an automated test system for accuracy verification of a specific power quality measurement instrument according to parts of EN 61000-4-30. The tests run automatically and are designed to be carried out �in the field� without dismounting the measurement instrument. In the actual stage the project was realized as �proof of concept� in co-operation with a test equipment manufacturer and a measurement instrument manufacturer.},

Two network models, incorporating both transmission and distribution system representations, were utilized. For each model, different parameters were considered for sensitivity studies, and the harmonic impedance at the transmission level was computed for each scenario. The findings indicate that some of the parameters result in notable effects only locally, while others impact impedance at the transmission system buses. Common parameters that affect both networks are identified, and future work is outlined.},
